the game starts with two asteroids crashing into eachother which gives you 10$


go left to access the shop
go right to access the tailor

make your ship look at boxes to select them and
shoot at them to use them
shooting at boxes in the shop explodes them
shooting at boxes in the tailor doesn't move the boxes at all, just darkens the chosen color

menu could also be navigated by a smaller version of the ship shooting at settings to toggle them


replace lives with a system in which you lose half your points each time you die


the more points you have, the more points you get, which makes for a sort of risk/reward type deal
so you can buy something as soon as you have enough points OR
you can hold on to them and risk losing them all/losing half of all your points
