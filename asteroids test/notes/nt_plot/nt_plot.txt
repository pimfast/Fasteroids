CHAPTER 1: (space plaza) :)
CHAPTER 2: (planet plaza) :]
CHAPTER 3: (ship plaza) :(
CHAPTER 4: (behind space) :D

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL PLOT:

player spawns in a box and after a while it expands to infinity or whatever
then they go far off and find an asteroid
they save the splaza (space plaza) from said asteroid and put the whole place on a safer spot:
a planet/the asteroid from earlier (not sure yet)

the planet is slightly less cool.

the inside of the ship is extremely less cool.

it ends with the player bringing the whole gang with their own ships like a star fox sorta thing
and taking them to a weak spot in space where they can enter the third dimension thanks to some 
technilogical wonders. anyway they go UNDERNEATH space (bringing the camera too) and look up
to see all sorts of asteroids and stars and shit. finally the splaza has found a safe place.

credits roll. end game.
if you play after this happens you enter the POSTGAME


the splaza while happy to be safe from harm, is dissapointed by the lack of any other customers being 
able to find the splaza

so you begin by making an entrance so other people can enter through to the splaza. 
and after that you can keep buying like billboards and signs and stuff so
more people come, also you can fight off random robbers and stuff.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECFIC STUFF:

the player flies up from the bottom of the screen in the splaza and witnesses two asteroids crashing into eachother
the asteroids drop 10$ and if they don't move for 10 seconds arrow keys appear on screen
the player picks up the currency and a full second later a red carpet appears on the left of the screen
then text goes on screen that says
     CHAPTER 1:
Welcome to the splaza
            (space-plaza)
the player goes in there, buys a laser, and leaves to go and shoot more asteroids
after the player gets enough currency they buy the radar, go outside, and see the tiny box expand massively as the music kicks in
when the player goes far enough and returns they find hubert has set up a tailor just opposite of the shop
if the player goes REAL far they find a HUGE asteroid and a little animation plays and the player hurries back to the town

if you go to hubert first he says
Hubert: "welcome"
Player: *ship panic*
H: "i see"
H: "go bring wyatt, i need his help"
P: *goes to wyatt*
W: "hey man"
you bring wyatt to hubert and see that hubert has already gotten started on making the lasso out of the far-outfits
wyatt helps hubert and they finish up the lasso, the camera zooms out as you use the lasso on the splaza
you bring the splaza over to a planet and let go you land on this planet and text goes on screen that says
      CHAPTER 2:
Welcome to the pplaza



if you go to wyatt first you break down his door and he says
Wyatt: "you break it you buy it pal"
Player: *ship panic*
Wyatt: "a what?"
P: *shoots twice*
W: "oh crap"
W: "we gotta do something"
W: "what do we do?"
W: "think. think. think!"
W: "i've got nothing man!"
W: "i'm sorry"
P: *about to leave*
W: "I GOT IT!"
W: "head to hubert and get materials, we're gonna make a lasso"
W: "QUICKLY!"
P: *goes to wyatt*
H: "welcome"
P: *ship panic*
H: a lasso you say?
H: out of my far outfits?
H: *fine

the huge asteroid has to make a very noticable TING noise to make sure people know shooting it does nothing
