whenever you enter he says some random dialogue from the list below the list below with a cooldown of 60 seconds after you leave

WELCOME TO THE GRAND OPENING OF THE SHOP!

To the right you'll find the enhancements. You are absolutely gonna want those.

To the left you'll find the upgrades. Those are pretty much just bigger enhancements.

Over here you'll find the counter. There is a guy standing here named Wyatt. (that's me haha)

[player goes to enhancments and then comes back]

*looks up at the score* Only 10 points eh?

That's not quite enough for the laser enhancement but since you're my first customer you get a discount!

Very generous of me, I know.

-------------------------------

I heard the explosion out there and I just knew someone gained points!

I set up this shop as quickly as I could.

Glad I finally have someone to sell all this stuff to.


You may be wondering:

"What's Wyatt gonna do with all this money?"

Buy more upgrades and enhancements for this store of course!

I know a guy.

...

I wonder what he does with the money?


I would've gotten upset at you for bringing your whole ship into my shop
but honestly there's nothing in here for you to break

That is, except my heart.

Just kidding!

It's already broken.


Bet you're real curious what I look like under this helmet.

But have you ever considered the possibility this helmet is actually just my face?

After all, there is oxygen in here.

Daahhh I'm just joshin' ya. This shop has no oxygen.

Though maybe installing a field COULD get me more customers.


[if the player is wearing something different for the first time]
Lookin' spiffy!
